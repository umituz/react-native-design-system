/**
 * useReanimatedReady Hook
 *
 * React hook to check if react-native-reanimated is fully initialized and ready.
 * This prevents errors when Reanimated's internal state (like layoutState) is accessed
 * before it's fully ready.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * const { isReady } = useReanimatedReady();
 *
 * if (!isReady) {
 *   return null; // Don't render Reanimated components until ready
 * }
 *
 * return <Animated.View>...</Animated.View>;
 * ```

/**
 * Hook to check if Reanimated is ready
